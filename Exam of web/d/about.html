 Literature Program seeks to rethink what comparison might mean in a world rapidly 
        being altered by complex forces of economic and technological integration. Although a focus on
            language, literature, and aesthetics continues<br> to ground our work, we have pioneered by drawing 
            together philosophical and theoretical reflections on the status of<br> “literature” and “culture” with work
             in history, political 
            economy, the sociology of culture, anthropology, visual culture, and cinema studies, all of which seeks to make 
            sense of the complex factors affecting the historically changing nature of the<br> relationship between society and culture. Literature
             has, in short, employed philosophical critique to interrogate and mediate our relationship to the social sciences, thereby modeling a
              new kind of program in global studies from the perspective of the humanities,<br> a program that recognizes that literature and culture are always crucially important agents in
         the understanding, definition and alteration of social formations.</p>
