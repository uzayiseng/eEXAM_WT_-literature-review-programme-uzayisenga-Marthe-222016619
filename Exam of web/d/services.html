    <p>The Graduate Program in Literature (GPL) endeavors to train future scholars<br> in theory and global culture. Originally conceived as a critical expansion<br> of "comparative literature" beyond its founding Eurocentrism and its (near) exclusive focus on literature and language, <br>the GPL hosts a robust range of scholarship and teaching in a variety of areas, ranging from feminist and gender studies to political <br>theory and Marxism, from psychoanalysis to cognitive studies and neuroscience, from philosophy of language<br> and experimental literature to media studies in the digital age, and from global cinema and film theory to visual culture<br> and postcolonial studies. The program defines itself through its diverse investment in theory and is dedicated to understanding literary<br> and cultural history as a complex and evolving exchange between the past and the (future-oriented) <br>present.

        The immense geopolitical changes of the last decades have challenged <br>the logic of the traditional disciplines, altered the status of the arts, and interrogated <br>classical aesthetic values. With its broad and open-ended embrace of global cultural objects <br>and processes, the GPL seeks to theorize the cultural upheaval of recent times in all of its contemporary<br> richness. By questioning the traditional conception of literature as a privileged cultural domain, and<br> of the literary text as an isolatable aesthetic object, the GPL adopts a "post-textualist"<br> approach to culture - including literature - that engages the profusion of diverse modes of production across<br> received boundaries. We encourage our students to explore the connection between theory<br> and <br>innovations in other disciplines - anthropology, psychoanalysis, philosophy, art history, <br>film and media, gender and <br>sexuality studies, religious studies, the history and philosophy of science and<br> technology, law - that share an investment in narrativity, <br>structure, communication, and interpretation<br>.
        
        Highlights of Our Program
        To ensure success in the teaching profession, the GPL <br>requires all students to pursue a double specialization that interweaves a "research" field with a <br>"teaching" field. The former designates students' specific theoretical inquiry<br> within the broad cultural field, while the <br>latter is intended to embed this research within larger, pre-existing<br> areas of scholarship, as <br>a way both to make the theoretical inquiry professionally legible and to <br>enhance its scope of relevance within the rapidly< br>morphing scene that is the <br>Humanities today. Together with appropriate teaching experience, this double <br>specialization is intended to guarantee that our students are solidly and <br>widely trained while affording them the opportunity to pursue their own <br>theoretical interests wherever they may lead. In sum, the GPL seeks to develop <br>critical and independent thought combined with substantial <br>training in research, and to allow each student, within these parameters, to construct <br>their own intellectual program. Many of our graduates have gotten jobs<br> in English or other literature departments, while others have found <br>positions in departments of cinema and media studies, gender and sexuality studies, and cultural <br>studies, among others.
        
        The Graduate Program in Literature has an M.A.-en-route option, <br>which is made available<br> to Literature graduate students as soon as they have successfully passed <br>their preliminary exams in their 3rd year. This is not <br>automatically awarded; students must meet departmental<br> and Graduate School requirements.  
        
        The <br>culminating requirement for the M.A.-en-route option is the<br> successful passing of the preliminary exams. <br>Furthermore:
        
        the student would need to have completed all Literature course requirements
